       A Sports Massage is the manipulation of the soft tissue (muscle) in order to prevent or improve sports injuries. A manual therapy which is suitable for a wide range of people, not just active sports people, or those in training but also those who have stress and soreness from busy daily activities. Sports Massage is extremely effective in loosening tight muscles and breaking up adhesions or knots in muscle fibres. It is based on the philosophy that direct techniques can reduce pain, enhance healing and restore and/or maintain optimum muscle function.

          A Deep Tissue Massage is perfectly explained by its name. The pressure is adjusted to manipulate the deeper tissue layers in the body. ... This is a job for a specially trained sports massage therapist. This massage aims to reduce muscle tension, joint stiffness and chronic pain. It targets connective tissue that may have formed into stubborn, fibrous knots and stimulates and conditions the muscular system. A great remedial massage treatment which as the name suggests really gets in there and is quite intense, leaving you lighter and relaxed to cope with the world.

          Similar to Swedish Massage but the difference is that with Hot Stone Massage you're actually applying all the same strokes that you would with Swedish Massage, except with stones. ... Many people like to have the hot stones on their body, because it's warm and it's relaxing, and so it adds a whole other layer of nuance to the Swedish Massage. Hot Stone Massage therapy can be likened to having a hot bath without getting wet, or burying your feet in warm sand. It’s a lovely way to de-stress and creates a sense of deep relaxation.

          Traditional, or Swedish Massage is the most popular Western massage, and most commonly offered massage technique. Its purpose is to relax the entire body, but it also has a number of other health benefits.  Swedish massage improves blood circulation, increases the level of oxygen in the blood, helps the body to remove toxins, improves flexibility, eases tension and stress and helps with pain management. Swedish massage utilizes a firm or lighter pressure on the muscles. It will involve long yet gliding strokes. ... Deep tissue massage is a specific type of massage that targets deeper structures of muscles and fascia, which is more commonly known as connective tissue.

        A Combination Massage is a massage integrating more than one style or massage modality. It can combine techniques from Swedish massage, deep tissue massage, reflexology, trigger point therapy and hot stone. These combinations are used to tailor the massage towards your personal preferences and specific needs.  .This most frequently requested combination massage is comprised of the Swedish Massage and Deep Tissue Massages. The deeper work is targeted in the areas where extra work is needed to soothe and relax those very tight muscles. It is an excellent starter massage along with the best for regular body maintenance.

           A Holistic Facial contains the same principles as a regular Facial in that a routine of a double cleanse, tone, exfoliation, mask, warm face towel, face, neck and shoulder massage (including a choice of head or hand massage) and moisturiser. Yet it takes a holistic approach concentrating on the person as a whole and not just what skin type that person has. Skincare products used in all of our facials also work holistically on the skin and mind as they contain a number of essential oils, they are free from endocrine disrupting chemicals and harsh preservatives. Skincare products used are natural and sustainably sourced.

The term tui na (pronounced "twee naw"), which literally means "pinch and pull," refers to a wide range of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) therapeutic massage and body work. It uses the principles of acupuncture. Tui na is not generally used for pleasure and relaxation, but rather as a treatment to address specific patterns of disharmony. Along with working to balance Yin and Yang energies, Tui Na recognizes the importance of a healthy spine. Opening blockages along the spine is crucial to allowing the body to heal itself. Tui Na, along with acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine, are the main components of Traditional Chinese Medicine. As such, Tui Na can be used to treat specific areas, or it can be used to improve the overall Qi or energy flow throughout the body.

         Pregnancy massage is customised to an expectant mother's needs but is most often used to promote relaxation. Since many pregnant women suffer from lower back pain and swollen ankles especially in the later months, prenatal massage is a safe, drug-free way to provide relief. Pregnancy massage has been found to relieve back, muscle and joint pain, sciatica, leg cramps, headaches and reduce swelling and stress. It is a popular alternative for pain relief, as medications are often limited. (Please read our article on Pregnancy Massage for more information.)

            A stress-busting relaxing massage for the upper back, neck, shoulders, arms, hands and face, as well as the head. Indian Head Massage has been performed in India in families for generations and was called Champi (the origin of the word shampoo). Herbs and spices were often added to the oils to give an overall therapeutic effect to the treatment. Today it has been adapted to help with many of the health issues arising in our Western Civilisation.

           One of the most popular ways to use aromatherapy is through a massage. The essential oils are added to a carrier oil to dilute the mixture and are then massaged into the skin. An aromatherapy massage usually lasts between one hour and 90 minutes. This will be tailored to suit your specific requirements. Aromatherapy massages are incredibly relaxing. They give you the opportunity to reap the benefits of both aromatherapy and massage. Aromatherapy massage and essential oil blends are adapted to suit the needs of the client.

            Massage Therapists can easily combine Quantum-Breath with their massage work. Sometimes energy can work at a greater depth than massage work, especially if the client is injured. Because energy healing uses a light touch, (and sometimes no touch) energy healing can also be applied where massage work may be contraindicated. Also, massage therapists can use energy healing during the massage to increase the therapeutic work of the massage and allow the client to go into deep states of relaxation and connection.

           The holistic back ritual is a back facial based on a "holistic" philosophy; the skin care products used are based on an understanding of the way skin works and its relationship with overall health. Holistic back rituals are the ideal treatment if you suffer from a dry, blemished or congested back, or whether you simply want to indulge in a luxuriously pampering spa treatment. The back facial follows the same basic layout as a traditional facial, a double cleanse, tone, exfoliation, mask and moisturise, helping to detox, balance and revitalise those hard-to-reach areas of your back.
