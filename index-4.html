<h1><strong>CANCELLATION POLICY</strong></h1>
<h3>In order to minimize disruptions to my schedule, I require 24 hours notice to change, cancel and/or reschedule Therapy appointments. If 24 hours is not given, the client will be responsible to pay the full 100% charge of the scheduled appointment. If the booked appointment is missed with no contact a 100% charge will be applied. If block bookings are purchased they cannot be refunded after 6 months. Cancellation of block bookings is only possible within 24 hrs, a gift voucher will be offered for the amount paid. 

Please be aware that when booking an appointment on the same day, it is considered set, and if changed, cancelled or rescheduled at any point after it is made, the client is responsible for paying for the full price of the appointment.

Cancellation fees are in effect to ensure that I am fully compensated for my time. Please keep in mind that if inadequate notice is given it is extremely difficult to fill vacant spots, this not only negatively impacts me as I only get paid when I deliver a treatment, but also affects my clients. Please be courteous to me and other clients by respecting my policies.</h3><br>
